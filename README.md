# Feature Selection Benchmark for Tabular Data
This repository contains a comprehensive benchmark study of feature selection techniques for supervised machine learning on tabular data, focusing on tree-based predictive models. The study evaluates 20 different feature selection methods across 100 datasets (50 synthetic and 50 real-world) with diverse characteristics.

## Key Features

Implementation of 20 feature selection methods across five categories:

- Filter methods (univariate and multivariate)
- Wrapper methods (forward, backward, and floating selection)
- Embedded methods (importance-based approaches)
- Advanced methods (SHAP, Boruta)
- Hybrid methods (combinations of the above)


Evaluation framework includes:

- Synthetic dataset generation with controlled feature relationships
- Real-world dataset processing and evaluation
- Performance metrics for both synthetic and real-world scenarios
- Comprehensive analysis across different dataset characteristics
