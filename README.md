# Feature Selection Benchmark

A comprehensive benchmark study of feature selection techniques for supervised machine learning predictive models on tabular data.

## Overview

This repository implements and evaluates 20 feature selection methods across different categories (filter, wrapper, embedded, hybrid and advanced) using both synthetic and real-world datasets. The study provides practical insights into the effectiveness of different feature selection techniques across various scenarios. A pipline to generate synthetic datasets with various characteristics and complex relationships is also provided. The only thing not provided in the repository is the data, however synthetic dataset can be generated by running synthetic_data_generation/main.py and th used real-world dataset is available and can be downloaded in Appendix 8.2 of miguel_moral_tfg.pdf file.

## Key Features

- Implementation of 20 feature selection methods
